# Cohort Analysis: Analyze User Retention (Based on time)
## I. INTRODUCTION 
### 1. Cohort Analysis
#### What is Cohort? 
A cohort is a collection of users who have something in common. A traditional cohort, for example, divides people by the week or month of which they were first acquired. When referring to non-time-dependent groupings, the term segment is often used instead of the cohort.

#### Why Cohort Analysis is important? 
To measure user engagement over time. It helps to know whether user engagement is actually getting better over time or is only appearing to improve because of growth. Customers are divided into mutually exclusive cohorts, which are then tracked over time. Vanity indicators don’t offer the same level of perspective as cohort research.

#### Three major types of Cohort:
* Time cohorts: customers who signed up for a product or service during a particular time frame.
* Behavior cohorts: customers who purchased a product or subscribed to service in the past.
* Size cohorts: refer to the various sizes of customers who purchase the company’s products or services.

#### For this project:
* Focus on Time cohorts.
* Customers will be divided into acquisition cohorts depending on the month of their first purchase.
* The cohort index would then be assigned to each of the customer’s purchases, which will represent the number of months since the first transaction.

### 2. Business question:
* Using Python to analyze transaction data from KPMG and creating a cohort that allows stakeholders to assess user engagement starting from their first transaction.
