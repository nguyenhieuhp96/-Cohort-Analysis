# Cohort Analysis: Analyze User Retention (Based on time)
I. INTRODUCTION
1. What is Cohort?

A cohort is a collection of users who have something in common. A traditional cohort, for example, divides people by the week or month of which they were first acquired. When referring to non-time-dependent groupings, the term segment is often used instead of the cohort.


2. Why Cohort Analysis is important?

To measure user engagement over time. It helps to know whether user engagement is actually getting better over time or is only appearing to improve because of growth. Customers are divided into mutually exclusive cohorts, which are then tracked over time. Vanity indicators donâ€™t offer the same level of perspective as cohort research.**
